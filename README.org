* cDisPass

  cdispass is a JavaScript-based wrapper around [[http://dispass.babab.nl/][DisPass]] for the
  [[http://conkeror.org][Conkeror Web Browser]].

** Usage

   To use cdispass: Add its location to your load_paths and require it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     load_paths.push("/path/to/cdispass/");
     require("cdispass");
   #+END_SRC

   And then you can use =M-x dispass= or you could bind
   =dispass-and-submit= to some key, like:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     define_key(content_buffer_text_keymap, "C-c d", "dispass-and-submit");
   #+END_SRC

   Which would cause =C-c d= to call the =dispass= command, insert the
   result in the current focused element and then submit the form in
   which the element is placed.
